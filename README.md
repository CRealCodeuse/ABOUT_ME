🤩 HEY THERE ! Welcome on my GitHub !

🎓 My name is Elise. 
💻 I'm in a Web Developpement Bachelor and currently looking for an apprenticeship for now.

💼 On here you can see my things I coded, as my portfolio and projects.
🔗My portfolio doesn't have a web domain bought yet, but I'm working on it.

Languages I know and work with for the moment : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, Php. Others are on the way of learning, don't worry !

👌 Pros: May be obsessed with having a clean code, and learning fast.
🥲 Cons: I hate letting some bug interfere in my work, so I always try to debog my code by myself as soon as I see one even If I have to spend time on it.

💖 I appreciate if you like my work. Let's be better together !

💖 Xoxo !
